# pop.py - Pop Random URL

A GUI to open a random URL from a list one at a time in the browser.

## Usage

Requires Python 3.

* Run `pop.pyw`
* Select a `.txt` file containing a list of URLs separated by new lines.
* Press the button (or the P key)

Unless the "Don't delete" checkbox is ticked, _popping_ a random URL will delete its line from the given file.

_Popping_ a URL will have it automatically opened in the browser.
